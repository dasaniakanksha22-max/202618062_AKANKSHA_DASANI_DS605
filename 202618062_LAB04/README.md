## Task 1: Data Analysis and Preparation

### 1. Dataset Inspection & Missing Values
The raw dataset contains 48,895 listings and 16 columns. While looking at missing values:
- `reviews_per_month` and `last_review` had 10,052 missing rows (about 20.5% of the data). When checking these rows, we found that all of them had `number_of_reviews == 0`. It makes sense that if a property has zero reviews, its monthly review rate is 0. So we filled missing `reviews_per_month` with `0.0`.
- `name` had 16 missing values and `host_name` had 21. We filled them with `'Unknown'`.
- Columns like `id` and `host_id` are arbitrary database identifiers with no predictive meaning, so we dropped them.

### 2. Handling Price Outliers & Target Transformation
Looking at the target variable (`price`):
- 11 listings had a price of \$0, which are invalid data points, so we removed them.
- Prices ranged from \$10 up to \$10,000. However, 99.5% of listings were priced under \$1,000. The handful of listings above \$1,000 were extreme outliers that distorted regression losses (especially squared errors). For model training stability, we restricted prices to between \$10 and \$1,000.
- The price distribution is strongly right-skewed. To fix this, we applied a log transformation:
  $$\text{log\_price} = \log(1 + \text{price})$$
  This turned the skewed price distribution into a near-normal distribution, which helps linear models and gradient boosting trees optimize better. When making predictions, we convert back using:
  $$\hat{\text{price}} = \exp(\hat{y}) - 1$$

### 3. Key Findings from EDA
- **Room Type:** Entire homes/apartments have a median price around \$160/night, whereas private rooms average \$70 and shared rooms are around \$45. Room type is one of the strongest predictors of price.
- **Boroughs:** Manhattan is by far the most expensive borough (mean ~\$197), followed by Brooklyn (mean ~\$124). Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx are noticeably more affordable.
- **Geographic distribution:** Listings are heavily concentrated in Manhattan and north-western Brooklyn, right along major subway lines.

### 4. Feature Engineering
We engineered several new features based on domain knowledge:
- `dist_to_midtown`: The Haversine distance in kilometers from each listing to Midtown Manhattan (Times Square: 40.7580, -73.9855). Listings closer to Midtown have significantly higher prices (negative correlation of -0.38).
- `dist_to_wall_st`: Distance to Lower Manhattan / Wall Street.
- `name_length`: Character length of the listing title. Detailed titles often correlate slightly with more professional listings.
- `minimum_nights_capped`: Minimum nights capped at 30 days (standard short-term rental threshold in NYC).
- `is_commercial_host`: Binary flag indicating whether a host has more than 1 listing.
- `has_reviews`: Binary flag indicating if the property has ever received a review.
- `neighbourhood_grouped`: The dataset has 221 unique neighbourhoods. We kept the top 25 most frequent neighbourhoods and grouped the remaining rare ones into `'Other'` to avoid creating too many sparse dummy columns.

Numerical features were scaled using `StandardScaler`, and categorical features (`room_type`, `neighbourhood_group`, `neighbourhood_grouped`) were encoded using `OneHotEncoder`. All of this was packed into an `sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer`.

## Task 2: Model Training and Evaluation

### 1. Model Comparison
We split the data into an 80% training set (38,916 listings) and a 20% test set (9,729 listings). The preprocessing pipeline was fitted strictly on the training set to prevent data leakage.

We trained and compared 7 regression models:
1. Linear Regression (baseline)
2. Ridge Regression ($L_2$ regularization)
3. Lasso Regression ($L_1$ regularization)
4. Decision Tree Regressor
5. Random Forest Regressor
6. XGBoost Regressor
7. LightGBM Regressor

Evaluation metrics calculated on both log scale and converted back to original dollar values:

| Model | Train $R^2$ (Log) | Test $R^2$ (Log) | Train MAE (\$) | Test MAE (\$) | Train RMSE (\$) | Test RMSE (\$) | Test $R^2$ (Price) | CV $R^2$ Mean | Training Time |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **XGBoost** | 0.6933 | 0.6518 | 42.00 | 45.18 | 81.72 | 87.83 | 0.4471 | 0.6311 | 0.63s |
| **LightGBM** | 0.6736 | 0.6501 | 43.12 | 45.30 | 83.78 | 88.04 | 0.4444 | 0.6292 | 3.37s |
| **Random Forest** | 0.7983 | 0.6469 | 33.86 | 45.32 | 70.51 | 87.87 | 0.4466 | 0.6237 | 3.44s |
| **Decision Tree** | 0.6411 | 0.6066 | 44.99 | 48.10 | 86.45 | 91.39 | 0.4014 | 0.5809 | 0.53s |
| **Linear Regression** | 0.5744 | 0.5856 | 49.09 | 49.26 | 93.87 | 94.04 | 0.3661 | 0.5732 | 0.12s |
| **Ridge Regression** | 0.5744 | 0.5854 | 49.09 | 49.26 | 93.88 | 94.06 | 0.3659 | 0.5732 | 0.04s |
| **Lasso Regression** | 0.5703 | 0.5793 | 49.16 | 49.39 | 94.24 | 94.56 | 0.3591 | 0.5694 | 1.34s |

![Model Benchmark](reports/figures/model_comparison.png)

### 2. Overfitting and Underfitting Analysis
- **Underfitting:** The linear models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso) had an $R^2$ of only about 0.585 on both train and test sets. Because price relationships in NYC depend on non-linear geographic factors (e.g., proximity to transit hubs, parks, tourist areas), linear lines cannot capture the real pricing boundaries.
- **Overfitting:** Random Forest showed clear signs of overfitting: its training $R^2$ was 0.7983 while test $R^2$ dropped to 0.6469 (a gap of 0.15). Without heavy regularization, deep decision trees memorize specific noisy listings.
- **Best Balance:** Gradient boosting models (LightGBM and XGBoost) achieved the highest test performance ($R^2 \approx 0.652$, MAE $\approx \$45.18$) with a much smaller train-test gap ($\approx 0.02$).

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
We selected LightGBM for hyperparameter tuning using 3-fold `GridSearchCV` over parameters like `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `num_leaves`, `subsample`, and `colsample_bytree`.
- **Best parameters found:** `n_estimators=250`, `learning_rate=0.08`, `num_leaves=45`, `subsample=0.8`, `colsample_bytree=0.8`
- **Tuned performance on test data:**
  - Test $R^2$ (Log scale): **0.6540**
  - Test MAE: **\$45.09**
  - Test RMSE: **\$87.59**
  - Test $R^2$ (Dollar scale): **0.4501**

| Actual vs Predicted & Residuals | Feature Importance |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![Residuals](reports/figures/actual_vs_predicted_and_residuals.png) | ![Feature Importance](reports/figures/feature_importance.png) |

### 4. Feature Importance Insights
The top features driving price predictions are:
1. `room_type_Entire home/apt`: Strongly increases the predicted price.
2. `dist_to_midtown`: Listings farther from Midtown Manhattan have lower prices.
3. `latitude` and `longitude`: Fine-grained neighborhood location effects.
4. `availability_365`: Properties available all year round tend to be run by commercial hosts with slightly higher rates.
5. `minimum_nights_capped`: Listings requiring longer stays often offer discounted per-night rates.

We packaged the preprocessor and the tuned LightGBM model into an end-to-end `Pipeline` and saved it to `models/pipeline.joblib`.

## Task 3: Streamlit Web Application

We built an interactive web application in `app.py` using Streamlit.

### Features of the Web App
- **Interactive Inputs:** Select borough, neighborhood (filtered dynamically by borough), room type, minimum nights, reviews, availability, and host listings count.
- **Auto-Coordinates:** Selecting a neighborhood automatically fills in its typical latitude and longitude.
- **Quick Test Scenarios:** Buttons for realistic preset listings (e.g. Midtown Manhattan Apartment, Williamsburg Brooklyn Room, Astoria Queens Stay).
- **Valuation Card:** Displays the estimated nightly price along with an expected confidence range ($\pm \text{MAE}$) and budget tier.
- **Interactive Tabs:** Contains tabs for price prediction, exploratory data analysis plots, model comparison tables, and project background.

### Testing with Realistic Scenarios
We validated the saved pipeline across 4 realistic test listings:

| Scenario | Borough | Room Type | Predicted Price | Tier |
|:---|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Midtown Manhattan Entire Apt** | Manhattan | Entire home/apt | **\$281.57** / night | Premium |
| **Williamsburg Brooklyn Room** | Brooklyn | Private room | **\$94.81** / night | Moderate |
| **Astoria Queens Budget Stay** | Queens | Private room | **\$73.79** / night | Budget Friendly |
| **Mott Haven Bronx Shared Room** | Bronx | Shared room | **\$43.13** / night | Budget Friendly |

The predictions align well with actual market rates in New York City.

## Task 4: Final Summary and Limitations

### Summary of Work Done
1. Cleaned 48,895 Airbnb listings, handled missing reviews logically, and filtered extreme price outliers.
2. Formulated a log transformation to handle target skewness.
3. Created domain features like distance to Midtown and commercial host flags.
4. Benchmarked 7 models, analyzed train vs test errors to check overfitting/underfitting, and tuned LightGBM with 3-fold cross validation.
5. Saved the complete pipeline and built a user-friendly Streamlit web app deployed online.

### Limitations of the System
1. **Missing Amenities:** The dataset does not include specific amenities (such as WiFi, air conditioning, elevator, pool, washer/dryer, or balcony view). In reality, these have a large impact on whether a listing can charge a luxury rate.
2. **Pre-Pandemic / Static Data:** The dataset is from 2019. In late 2023, New York City enacted Local Law 18, which strictly restricted short-term rentals under 30 days without the host present. The current Airbnb landscape in NYC is different from 2019.
3. **Seasonal and Event Spikes:** The dataset represents a single snapshot without dates of stay. Holiday periods (Christmas, New Year's Eve, Marathon weekend) have much higher rates that cannot be captured without calendar date data.
